<textarea id="reflection" name="reflection" cols="80" rows="30" style="background-color:#FCF5D8;color:#AD8C08;border:3px solid #AD8C08;"> In this quarter, there were a lot of new things I learned about. This was a really confusing quarter for me since there were a lot of new terms, but i eventually got the hang of it. I was even exempted 2 times in quizzes this quarter! One because of pisa, and the other one for my birthday :D I think i did really bad on the hands-ons this quarter, so im just hoping for a mircale :") One thing I could say about this quarter in general was that it was very busy. A lot of events here and there, but we managed to get pass through that. I also really enjoyed most of our quizzes this quarter, since our teacher has such a fun way of doing it. I look forward to every little hint that she gives for each question and my classmates' reeaction is just so funny to me. I will do my best next quarter to make up for my lackings this quarter. It's been pretty frustrating, but I know i can do better, so I will work harder. Our teacher, ms. uminga, has been really understanding and thoughtful this quarter, and I really enjoy every session even if it's hard most of the time. I hopr i'll be able to do better next quarter, and i promise myself to study more so I wont have a hard time anymore. This has been a fun yet tiring quarter, especially with all the events, but im still looking forward to more. I am very excited for the next quarters that we will have, and I hope i learn a lot there too. Thank you for reading! </textarea>
